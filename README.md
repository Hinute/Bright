# Greetings
Hello Friend.

Thanks for trying out Bright! This game is still a WIP, but feel free to try it out and play it.
We'll be updating this game every so often, so keep an eye out for any updates!

Game play instructions are in the game itself, so make sure to check to them out in the Menu before you play the game!

# Installation Instructions
Windows:
  1) Download the Windows install of Bright (something like `BrightGame.zip`
  2) Extract the zip contents
  3) Go in and run the .exe file (NOTE: you may need to run this as an administrator)

Mac:
  1) Download the Mac install of Bright (something like `BrightGame-Mac.app.zip`)
  2) Try find the location you downloaded the game to. Try running it.
    a) If the game successfully runs/installs, great! Play it and give us some feedback if you want!
    b) You can't get the game to run. That's okay, we got chu! (Warning: this is going to include some terminal shenanigans)
      * open up your bash terminal and navigate to the directory containing your download
        * Bash 101
          - ls: lists things in your current directory
          - cd ..: navigate up a directory
          - cd DIRECTORY_NAME: navigate down into the directory
      * run the command `chmod -R 777 BrightGame-Mac.app` to give the game executeable access rights
        * see here for specifics: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8328481/chmod-777-to-a-folder-and-all-contents
        * NOTE: you will probably need to be root admin to do this, otherwise you'll probably need to add `sudo` to the beginning of the chmod line. Google sudo if you want to know more :D.
      * Try running the app again. If it still doesn't work, this might be related to Guardian, the security stuff that comes preinstalled in Macs.
        * See here for deets: https://www.howtogeek.com/682509/mac-app-not-starting-heres-how-to-fix-it/
      * You should be good to run the game now!

# Final Words
Hope you have fun playing this game! Stay safe!
